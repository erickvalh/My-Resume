    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>I was introduce to the world of technology around 4 years ago, I started as a project manager, <br>
    but currently I'm starting to grow in this field. <br> My first contact with this world was when I started to work at Metria as Project Manager. Metria is a company that was trying to integrare tools like Slack, Monday, Github and others in one tool. I learned just a bit of what a project manager does without prevous knowledge, then I decided that I wanted to grow and then I took a course at Coursera to get my first certificate after working almost two years as Project Manager. Since I had to work side by side with designers and developers, I took a UX design course at Coursera. <br> Currently I work as Customer Success Advocate/Project Manager, where I have contact with customers of more than ten different products. I'm taking a developement course at Udemy because I want to be able to fully communicate with my developer teammates and in the future, start my career as Developer. </p>
